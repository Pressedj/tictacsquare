#Tic Tac Toe

Currently working well, with some design.
To do:
- Add another row below Player names so that you can actually see which player has what color
	- Possibly add a way to see whats selected
- Update the score counter
- Give the text elements a design
- test the mobile version
- Remove text from tiles
- Remove the flex-container border?
- refactor it for OOP
