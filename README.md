Anarchy Tic Tac Toe game allows players to take their opponent's tiles, but game must finish after 9 turns.
 
## Tech used: ![HTML5 BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=HTML5&color=23555f&style=plastic&logo=html5)![CSS BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=CSS3&color=285f65&style=plastic&logo=css3)![JAVASCRIPT BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript)

My learning was focused on JavaScript events and maniuplating the DOM. After that I was curious about JavaScript library imports so I played with howler.js.

## Optimizations
When I improve this project, I add a score board and possibly a bakground changer. Perhaps add local storage to keep score across browser instances.
Refactor the app for OOP.

## Lessons Learned:

.forEach can be pretty powerful, some animations can be completed in JavaScript as well as CSS
