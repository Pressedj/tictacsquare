# Tic Tac Toe but with Tiles!
*Jazz hands!*

Currently working well, with some design.
To do:
- Refactor for OOP

Complete -  Result notification  
Complete / Scrapped - Update the score counter  

Complete - Lock in player colors once per game  
Complete- test the mobile version  

Complete - Add another row below Player names so that you can actually see which player has what color  
Complete - Possibly add a way to see whats selected  
Complete - Give the text elements a design  
Complete - Remove the flex-container border?  

Had to do it by myself since my schedule is a pretty busy at the moment, so don't look under the hood I need to refactor it ðŸ¥²
